            <para>
                Combat in <s>YAGS</s> can be bloody and brutal, and can
                often lead to the death of those who are ill-prepared or over
                confident. You may be a hero, but a sharp stick or lucky
                bullet can still take you down just as quickly as it can
                an unskilled opponent.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, combat in <s>YAGS</s> is also geared towards
                <e>Cinematic Realism</e> - it may be gritty and lean towards
                realism where possible, but it allows you to be heroic as
                long as you're clever as well. The advantage goes to whoever
                has surprise or a careful plan. Having both is even better.
            </para>

            <para>
                As with the rest of the system, combat in <s>YAGS</s> is
                reasonably detailed, but tries to be quick and consistent.
                Complexity is added where it is believed that it adds to
                the flavour of a game.

                <title>Organisation of These Rules</title>

                <para>
                    These rules have been organised so as to keep the
                    simple stuff first, then go into more detail later.
                    The first few sections actually gives you everything
                    you need to know to run combat using <s>YAGS</s>. If all
                    you want is a simple and fast combat system, then
                    you can stick with that.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The later sections go into more detail however,
                    providing a bit more colour to the rules, and covering
                    situations more extensively. If you don't care about
                    different armour types or ways of using a gun, then
                    you can ignore them.
                </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>General Terminology</title>

                <para>
                    The following terms are used frequently within
                    these rules, so they are described up front. A
                    full description of how they are used will be
                    given later.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Round">
                        A round is a unit of time, averaging about five
                        seconds. Each round, you have chance to
                        perform a single action - normally an attack or a
                        move.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Body levels">
                        Body levels represent your ability to absorb damage
                        in the form of wounds and stuns. It is determined by
                        your size, so most adult humans have the same number
                        of body levels - five.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Soak">
                        Soak is how good you are at resisting (soaking) damage.
                        An adult human will usually have a soak of 12. Armour
                        can add to this, reducing the chance that an attack
                        damages you.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Wounds">
                        Wounds are serious injuries which have a good chance
                        of causing death. Martial weapons such as swords or
                        spears, as well as guns and bows cause wounds.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Stuns">
                        Stuns are non-serious injuries which rarely kill,
                        being generally limited to cuts and bruises. Fists,
                        sticks and chairs are likely to stun you.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Mixed damage">
                        Knives, clubs and animal claws or teeth are more
                        likely to kill you than a fist, but aren't as deadly
                        as a sword or gun. They do mixed damage, which is
                        split between stuns and wounds with odd damage doing
                        on stuns.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Ineffective damage">
                        Sometimes (if you're lucky), an attacker may find it
                        very hard to hurt you. In this case their attack is
                        considered ineffective. They do stun damage, but the
                        number of stuns is halved (rounding down).
                    </item>

                    <item name="Fatigue">
                        Fatigue is a measure of how tired you are, and how
                        much fatigue you can take before falling over is based
                        on your Health. Fatigue is recovered after a short rest.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Exhaustion">
                        Exhaustion is similar to fatigue, but can only be
                        recovered with sleep. It is gained from long term
                        physical activity such as hiking or heavy labour.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Damage">
                        Damage is what causes stuns or wounds. You roll the
                        damage and subtract the target's soak. Every five
                        points left causes one stun or wound.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Load">
                        A character can carry a load equal to the square of
                        their strength without penalty. Weapons, armour
                        and equipment carried add to load. The load rating of
                        an item is equal to its weight in kg x 4.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Stance">
                        Stance determines how a combatant is fighting, the
                        most common being normal, aggressive and defensive.
                        Prone and unsteady are two stances which a character
                        can be forced into.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Free strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent gets a free
                        defence roll, at the same penalty as other defence
                        rolls that round if multiple defences have been
                        declared.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Counter strike">
                        An extra attack which make be taken immediately
                        after the opponent's action which triggered it,
                        but otherwise treated as a free strike.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Automatic strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent does not get
                        a defence roll, so the attack is against the base
                        difficulty to hit the target.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Combat bonuses">
                        The three statistics which define the bonuses a
                        weapon provides to skill and damage rolls in combat
                        (attack, defence and damage).
                    </item>

                    <item name="Initiative">
                        Initiative determines the order in which everybody
                        acts, from highest initiative to lowest. Actions
                        are split into fast, normal and slow. All fast
                        actions happen first, then normal actions, then
                        slow actions.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Martial weapon">
                        Any melee weapon which does better than stun damage
                        and has a reach greater than zero.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Distance">
                        The distance to a target for missile weapons,
                        measured in metres. This affects how hard it is
                        to hit the target, and my be modified up or down
                        depending on other factors (such as if you're
                        running whilst trying to shoot).
                    </item>

                    <item name="Range band">
                        The effective range of missile weapons, measured in
                        metres. This is unaffected by modifiers to the
                        Distance, and effects how much damage the weapon
                        does.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Reach">
                        The reach of a melee weapon is an indication of how
                        long it is, and weapons with longer reach have an
                        advantage against shorter reach weapons. In a
                        confined space however, longer reach weapons have a
                        disadvantage. Missile weapons also have a reach,
                        which indicates how suitable they are in close combat.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Shock">
                        Particularly painful types of damage can cause shock,
                        which reduces your initiative.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Active defence">
                        An active defence is normally a dodge or a parry. You
                        must be aware of the attack to be able to make an
                        active defence, and you have a limited number you can
                        make in a round.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Passive defence">
                        You passive defence is a fixed number, and is the
                        difficulty for someone to hit you when you aren't
                        performing an active defence. It is normally 15.

                        pistols to sniper rifles and light machine guns. However,

                        Every melee weapon provides three combat bonuses -
                        <e>attack</e>, <e>defence</e> and <e>damage</e> which
                        add to the attack, defence an damage rolls of a

                        Missile weapons have a short, medium and long range
                        which determine their maximum effectiveness. They
                        also have an <e>increment</e>, which is a measure of
                        their accuracy and determines how hard it is to hit
                        a target.

                        There are plenty of other statistics for each weapon,
                        but these three are the primary ones which are used
                        in the basic combat system.

                    <para>
                        Every creature has a basic soak score, which reduces
                        the damage done to them in an attack. Armour gives a
                        protective bonus which adds to this soak, but may
                        cause you to suffer a penalty to actions.

                    <para>
                        Armour is either <e>light</e> or <e>heavy</e>. The
                        former isn't as effective against weapons designed
                        to penetrate armour, but is often less likely to
                        restrict your movement. In modern settings, some
                        armour is also rated as being <e>bulletproof</e>.
                        If it isn't, then effectiveness against firearms
                        is greatly reduced.

            <title>The Combat Sequence</title>

            <para>
                Once characters enter into a combat, game time is
                measured in <e>rounds</e> of approximately
                five seconds. At the start of each combat everybody
                determines their <e>initiative</e> which remains
                fixed for the entire combat. Initiative is rolled
                using:

            <para>
                If you fumble your initiative roll, then your initiative
                is zero. An initiative of zero is bad, because it halves
                all your skill checks and means that all your actions are
                <e>slow</e> (meaning that you always go last each round).
                You can opt to re-roll your initiative later in the combat,
                doing so means that you cannot take any other actions that
                round (including movement or defences), though this is
                also considered a skill check that is halved.
            </para>

            <para>
                If you do have an initiative of zero, then you can always
                choose to gain a level of <e>fatigue</e> to act normally
                that round. This can be used when re-rolling initiative.

                <para>
                    Each round of combat follows a set series of steps.
                    Once a round has been completed, combat either ends
                    or everyone starts a new round. Initiative is very
                    important in combat, since a high initiative gives
                    you a big tactical advantage over everyone else.

                <para>
                    At the start of each round, all combatants declare
                    their actions in order of increasing initiative. This
                    gives characters with a high initiative a big tactical
                    advantage over everybody else. Initiative should be
                    thought of as an abstraction of both physical speed and
                    tactical ability.

                    All declared actions are public, even if someone
                    is out of sight at the start of the round. If you
                    are hidden and out of sight, and wish to declare
                    that you are leaping out to attack someone, then
                    anyone who has a higher initiative than you gets
                    the opportunity to react to your action before
                    you do it - effectively they get to act between
                    you making yourself visible and actually performing
                    the attack.

                        You may declare an attack against a
                        target. Any movement required in order to make
                        the attack is implied. The weapon and skill
                        being used, plus any special actions, must be
                        declared at this point.

                        declared defence will defend against any number of
                        attacks from a single attacker. Defending against
                        multiple attackers means you suffer a penalty to
                        all attacks and defences that round.

                        the average of your agility and perception

                        If the event doesn't happen, then you don't do
                        anything that round. You <e>cannot</e> state that

                            A fatally wounded person must make health
                            rolls to remain conscious and alive every

                        As long as you are alive, you will never be in a

                        As soon as you receive damage that takes you to
                        fatally wounded or beyond, you must make a health
                        check at a target of 20 + 5 per extra wound. So,
                        if you were heavily wounded (4 wounds), and took
                        3 wounds of damage, you would be making a check
                        against a target of 25 (fatal, +1 extra).

                        If you fail this check, then you die, otherwise

                        success, then you can continue fighting, but
                        must make another check at the end of each round
                        at a target of 20. If you are unconscious or
                        resting you only need to make a check once every
                        minute.

                        <para>
                            Whilst wounds represent damage that is likely to
                            kill you, stuns represent scratches and bruises
                            that will heal naturally within a few days.

                            Brawling and similar attacks will do stun
                            damage. Stuns are inflicted in much the same
                            way as wounds are, with an opposed damage and
                            soak rolls. However, stuns are <e>not</e>
                            cumulative. If you receive more stuns in a
                            single blow than you currently have, then
                            the new number of stuns replaces what you
                            had previously. If you receive at least half
                            your current stun level, you gain one stun.

                            For example, you are currently uninjured, but
                            are punched by someone who does you two stuns.
                            You are now lightly stunned (at -5). You are
                            punched again for two stuns. This gives you
                            one extra stun, taking you to three stuns
                            (moderate, -10). A third punch only does one
                            stun, and since this is less than half your
                            current total, it does no damage.

                        <para>
                            The fourth punch is much harder, and does 5
                            stuns of damage. This is greater than your
                            current total (3), so puts you immediately
                            at 5 stuns (critical, -25).

                            If your stuns ever reach beaten, then you must
                            make a health check as for wounds, but failure
                            makes you unconscious, and success leaves you
                            standing.

                            separately, and their penalties add together.
                            If you have 3 stuns (moderate, -10) and two
                            wounds (light, -5) you have a total penalty of

                            cumulatively to both stuns and wounds. If you
