            <title>Spacecraft</title>

            <para>
                Though spacecraft are just another type of vehicle, they
                are provided their own section here for a number of reasons.
                Firstly, all the interesting spacecraft tend to be
                imaginary works of fiction, and the physics by which most
                of them operate are incompatible with each other. Firstly
                then, we need to lay down the laws by which spacecraft in
                <tm>YAGS</tm> work.
            </para>

            <para>
                Secondly, the <tm>YAGS</tm> rules for vehicles assume that
                designs are based on real life, or near real-life, designs.
                There is no real design system as such - just a set of
                guidelines to try and keep things vaguely consistent.
                Spacecraft will often be designed entirely from scratch
                without any basis in reality, so it helps to tie things
                down a bit.
            </para>

            <para>
                Thirdly, whilst most people have a good idea about how a
                car behaves, few people can get their head around space
                travel. Even if you don't drive, you've almost definitely
                been in a car that's travelled through a town centre, so
                you know how fast it goes and how long a journey takes.
                Most people don't have that common sense knowledge for
                a journey from Earth to Mars, or a trip around the
                moons of Saturn. A set of rules helps fill in for that
                lack of common sense.
            </para>

            <para>
                As with all rules in games, they can be ignored. However,
                the rules here do allow ships to be designed with a
                reasonable degree of accuracy. However, this does also
                mean that a little bit of maths may be involved.
            </para>

                <quote signature="Douglas Adams">
                    Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how
                    vastly mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think
                    it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's
                    just peanuts to space.

                <para>
                    The physics of <tm>YAGS SciFi</tm> is somewhat harder
                    than most Hollywood fiction. It can take days to weeks
                    to travel across the solar system, and weapon ranges
                    are in the order of tens of kilometres. Anti-gravity
                    exists, though only at higher tech levels and it can
                    be quite limited. Ships generally still move by throwing
                    hot stuff out the back very fast according to the
                    principles of Newtonian motion.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Sizes</title>

                    <para>
                        The size of ships is measured in displacement tonnes
                        of liquid hydrogen. 1 dt is about 15 cubic metres
                        (about 14.75 to be more precise, but 15 is assumed).
                        Ships below 10dt are rare - generally light fighters
                        and similar vessels. A typical ship that might be
                        owned by a group of PC's will be on the order of
                        100dt - 500dt in size.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Even the smallest fighters tend to be around
                        Size 15 in <tm>YAGS</tm> terms - larger than any
                        modern day tank. The largest vessels will be
                        hundreds of thousands of displacement tonnes,
                        with a million tonnes being extremely rare.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Note that an Imperial class Star Destroyer from
                        <em>Star Wars</em> would be over 4 million tonnes,
                        so ships are relatively small compared to those in
                        many Hollywood films.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Time and Movement</title>

                    <para>
                        Time is measured in turns of 10 seconds. This is
                        twice as long as a standard <s>YAGS</s> round, but
                        is a simpler number to deal with when working out
                        distances and acceleration.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        All distances are measured in kilometres. Effective
                        ranges of most space combats will vary from tens of
                        kilometres to hundreds of kilometres, depending on
                        the size of vessels involved. This ranges are
                        relatively small for space, and it means that objects
                        such as planets are huge relative to a combat arena.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        How quickly a spacecraft moves is measured by its
                        <e>acceleration</e>, which is given in 'g'. Every
                        'g' of acceleration allows the ship to accelerate
                        up to (roughly) 1km/turn/turn. A craft with an
                        acceleration of 3g, will be moving at 3km/turn
                        after the first turn, 6km/turn after the second
                        turn and so on.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        <e>Delta V (dV)</e> represents the maximum speed of a
                        space craft. Any ship using reaction drives (i.e.,
                        the type that burn 'fuel' and throw it out the
                        back) will have a maximum speed. <e>dV</e> means
                        change in velocity, so any acceleration (even if it
                        is to slow down, or change direction) comes out of
                        your total dV.

                <title>Technology Levels</title>
                <para>
                    The technology level (TL) is crucial in a SciFi game,
                    and likewise that carries over to the design of
                    spacecraft. It is assumed that all spacecraft are
                    TL6+, though really interesting designs don't start
                    becoming possible until TL9-10. If you want galaxy
                    spanning science fiction, then using these rules
                    you should be looking at TL13+
                </para>
                <sect3>
                    <title>TL 6</title>
                    <para>
                        The first space rocket was the German V2 which was
                        used in very late TL 6, however the 'going into space'
                        part was a side effect of the 'bomb London' part, so
                        space travel is normally thought to have started in
                        TL 7. However, the technology was there to do in TL6,
                        and people were definitely thinking about the subject.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Spacecraft built in this period are very basic,
                        have no computers of any sort and have very low
                        performance.
                    </para>
                </sect3>
                <sect3>
                    <title>TL 7-8</title>
                    <para>
                        By TL 7 we got to the Moon, by TL 8 we'd forgotten
                        how to do it. Space travel is hard and expensive,
                        and getting living creatures out of orbit is a big
                        project. Much better designs are possible at these
                        levels, as long as we don't mind irradiating ourselves
                        by using nuclear propulsion systems.
                    </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>TL 9-10</title>
                    <para>
                        Interplanetary travel starts to become feasible at
                        these levels, and space combat does as well. Travel
                        to the outer planets is still hard, and expensive,
                        but by late TL 10 it's not beyond the capability of
                        large corporations.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        It is assumed that basic interstellar travel becomes
                        possible during TL 10, in the form of Jump drives or
                        Hyperspace.

                    <para>
                        At this point space travel starts to become affordable
                        and practical for a much larger number of people, and
                        trade between worlds is an everyday occurrence.

            <sect2>
                <title>Design the Hull</title>

                <para>
                    The first decision point is the size of the ship. This
                    is measured in displacement tonnes, and for most jump
                    capable craft will be in the order of 100dt - 1000dt.
                    Ships bigger than this tend to be military vessels,
                    large freighters or cruise ships. The tonnage controls
                    how much room there is for weapons, drives, crew etc,
                    and also how much damage the ship can take.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The second decision is the rough shape of the vessel.
                    This affects the internal volume (space for things),
                    surface area (weight of armour and space for turrets)
                    and modifiers to Health and Agility.
                </para>

                    The volume multiplier gives the internal volume of the craft.
                    A 200dt <e>Dispersed</e> hull for example will only have 100dt

                    Area gives the surface area multiplier. The surface area is
                    equal to the square of the cube root of mass. Turrets, drives
                    and other surface features have to fit into the available
                    area. Surface area also governs armour - the bigger the surface
                    area, the greater the mass of armour required to give a
                    certain soak bonus.

                            The hull of a ship is the number of damage levels it
                            can sustain before being destroyed, and goes up with

                            volume, this roughly translates as a doubling of
                            length, width and height, assuming that the ships

                            A typical space craft has a <s>Soak</s> equal to its <s>Size</s>,
                            but this is modified by the craft's <t>Health</t>. Health is a
                            measure of the general toughness of a vehicle, and affects both
                            the soak and mass.

                            increasing it reduces both acceleration and delta vee. Adding
                            armour also increases the mass, so heavy warships tend to be
                            slower than flimsier craft.

                            a lot of maths, so we ignore this and assume an

                                3dt of thruster, they have a total mass of 16.5 (fuel
                                counts as half, though the gross mass is 30, the empty
                                mass closer to 3).

                                The <e>thrust</e> is 3 * 21 = 63. This gives an
                                acceleration of 63 / 16.5 = 3.8. The delta vee of
                                the booster is fuel tonnage (27) * impulse (1.5) = 40.

                                So the booster has a thrust of 3.8, which it will burn
                                for slightly over 10 turns. Once its fuel is depleted,
                                it will be travelling at 4 km/s.

                            Nuclear fission rockets work on a similar principle to
                            chemical rockets - a propellent is heated and thrown out
                            the back. However, instead of the propellent being used
                            as the fuel, the fuel is Uranium in a nuclear reactor,
                            which is used to heat a propellent such as water or
                            hydrogen.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            They are bigger and heavier than chemical rockets, so
                            a larger engine is needed for the same thrust. However,
                            they are a lot more efficient, so require far less fuel
                            for the same delta-v.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            They are both expensive and incredibly dirty, requiring a lot
                            of radiation shielding. If water is being used as a
                            propellent instead of hydrogen, add +5 to the basic
                            thrust, but reduce efficiency by 500.

                            Nuclear thermal drives are often invented around
                            TL 7, but are very often ignored as a practical
                            means of getting off planet unless there is an
                            overwhelming necessity for them (e.g., an alien
                            invasion). By the time they can be made light
                            and clean, they have been made obsolete by the
                            <e>plasma drive</e> (though even this is really a
                            different implementation of the same idea).

                            Also known as the <e>Orion Drive</e>, the Nuclear Pulse
                            Drive works by use of an external pulsed plasma propulsion
                            system. Basically, drop nuclear bombs out the back and use
                            the explosions to push you forward. It sounds insane, but
                            it was seriously considered in the 1960s. It is assumed
                            that a practical working drive could be produced by TL 8.

                            Early designs use pellets of fissionable material,
                            which would explode (possibly ignited using lasers)
                            against a pusher plate. Nuclear shielding would be
                            necessary, and launching from the surface of an
                            inhabited world is generally considered to be bad
                            form.

                            the drive includes the pusher plate and shielding.

                            Ion Drives are small, efficient drives with very low
                            thrust. They are short lived in usefulness, since
                            they cannot compete with the high thrust medium
                            efficiency drives that come into play during TL 9/10,

                            compared to a lot of the alternatives.

                    <para>
                        Repulsors are like tractor beams, but they push.
                        What they push against are nearby masses, such as
                        the ground. They are very short range, so can't be
                        used to traverse a solar system, but at high tech
                        levels they can be used to reach orbit.

                    <para>
                        They may be found on spacecraft which need to land
                        on planets, and tend to be used during the final
                        landing or take off, so as not to scorch the landing
                        area with the fusion torch drives.

                    <para>
                        <e>Jump Drives</e> are used to move between stars,
                        and allow faster than light travel. A 'Jump' always
                        takes a fixed amount of time - about a week - and
                        whilst in jump space a ship is out of contact with
                        the rest of the universe, including other ships in
                        jump space.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Jump drives are rated according to the distance they
                        travel during each jump, generally J1 to J6, where the
                        J number gives the number of parsecs travelled.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        A jump drive takes up tonnage equal to some proportion
                        of the ship size. This proportion goes down at higher
                        technology levels. Technology level also limits the
                        range of a Jump drive. Drives also require fuel, which
                        is again based on ship tonnage.
