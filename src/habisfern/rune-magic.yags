                Magic is given to us by the gods, who do not wish to see us
                grow stronger than them. Where we build, the magic fades away.
                It is in the dark forests and wild lands that the magic of the
                gods is strongest.

            <para>
                The World of Men, also known as the Middle Earth, is seen
                as solid and real, something which can be touched, felt and
                understood by everyone. Where man has built places to live,
                where cut wood and shaped stone mark the mark of civilisation,
                so the strength of the real world is greatest.
            </para>
            <para>
                Man though does not have full control over all things, and
                the further one goes from the shaped and bounded places
                which men call home, the thinner the walls are between this
                world and the <e>Dreamlands</e>. At night, the spirits of
                these other lands find a way into civilised areas though
                the dreams of men. In the unseen darkness and shadows of
                night, the rule of men is undone.
            </para>
            <para>
                Not all men though fear these other realms, there are some
                who actively seek them out, and try to command the powers
                that lay within them to do their bidding. Such people are
                commonly called Wizards, and with runes and words of power
                they can awaken the dream lands, and reshape the world of
                men to their bidding. With understanding though comes a
                price, for your mind cannot understand both the world of
                dreams and the world of men at the same time.
            </para>
            <para>
                The Wizards of Habisfern are descendants of rune smiths
                and shamans from older times. Their magic is simple and
                straightforward, and for the most part it deals with
                the problems faced by everyone day to day. Not anyone can
                learn and use magic, and the path to its mastery can be
                difficult. Corruption and insanity are two prices which
                may need to be paid for careless use of these powers.
            </para>
            <para>
                For this reason, Wizards are somewhat feared, and
                definitely distrusted. Too many have gone over the edge,
                giving in to the nightmares which fill their sleep, their
                mind linked too closely to the Dreamlands, leaving them
                unable to function sanely in the middle lands.

                <title>The Realms</title>

                <para>
                    The world of men is known as the Middle Earth, since
                    all other realms lay above and below it. It is a realm
                    of physical things, though in places it can be warped
                    where another realm touches upon it.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Below the Middle Earth is the <e>Under Earth</e>, also
                    known as the Realm of the Dead. It is said to be either
                    a huge cavern below all other places, or a maze of
                    twisty tunnels which are designed to confuse and trap
                    those who venture there. It is a quiet and empty place,
                    for most who come here do not last long, their spirits
                    soon being reborn back in the Middle Earth or with the
                    gods.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Above our world is the Over Earth, which is where the
                    gods are said to dwell. They take the spirits of those
                    that have pleased them from the Under Earth to dwell
                    with them in their paradise.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Surrounding and entwined with Middle Earth are the
                    Dreamlands. These are formed from the dreams of men and
                    gods, and are the home of living spirits such as the fey.
                    It is from the Dreamlands that the power of magic is
                    normally drawn. It is a place of dreams, easily moulded to
                    the wishes of those in it.

                <title>The Mysteries</title>

                <para>
                    Knowledge of magic is divided into seven
                    <e>Mysteries</e>, each of which grants the wizard power
                    over one part of the world. A wizard may learn any
                    number of Mysteries, though many only bother learning
                    one or two. Six of the Mysteries are considered to be
                    related to each other, being thought of as forming a
                    circle. Mysteries on opposite sides of the circle
                    oppose each other, and mastery of one will limit
                    ability in the other.
                </para>

                <svg src="images/rune-circle.svg" width="70mm" height="70mm"
                     align="center"/>

                <para>
                    The six main Mysteries are <e>Spirit</e>, <e>Water</e>,
                    <e>Earth</e>, <e>Iron</e>, <e>Fire</e> and <e>Air</e>.
                    There is a seventh, called <e>Dragon</e>, which stands
                    separate to the others. It cannot be learnt until the
                    others have been understood to a sufficient degree,
                    and it gives power over the fundamental reality of the
                    world. The nature of <e>Dragon</e> is not described in
                    this article, for its powers are unknown to most wizards.
                </para>
                <para>
                    A Mystery may be used in its raw form, or <e>runes</e> may
                    be learnt which unlock quicker, more powerful, effects.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Mysteries can be considered to form a circle, with each
                    one opposed by the one opposite. Learning an opposing
                    Mystery can interfere with what you know. Every full three
                    points of skill in a Mystery causes a -1 penalty to your
                    attribute when using an opposed Mystery.
                </para>
                <para>
                    A Mystery is supported by its two neighbours. For every
                    four full points of the lowest neighbour, you gain +1 to
                    your attribute when making a Mystery check.

                <title>Unlocking the Mysteries</title>
                <para>
                    Once you have learnt a Mystery to a level of 10, you may
                    teach its secrets to another. Only those who have faerie
                    ancestry in their veins can learn the Mysteries.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Learning your first mystery is a difficult task, and requires
                    that you have Fey Blood in order to have any chance of success.
                    It takes three months in total, though failure at any stage
                    means that the whole process must be restarted from the
                    beginning. No more than a week must pass between one month of
                    study and the next.
                </para>
                <para>
                    During the first month, you must open your mind to the world,
                    seeking understanding of the voices that penetrate from the
                    Dream Lands. With guidance from your teacher, you learn to
                    understand how the world speaks. At the end of the month, you
                    must have an <t>Intelligence</t> check at a target of 30.
                </para>
                <para>
                    During the second month, you learn to take charge of the voices,
                    and begin to exercise your will upon the world. At the end of
                    it you must make a <t>Will</t> check at a difficulty of 30.
                    If you succeed, you may proceed to the final stage of your
                    study.
                </para>
                <para>
                    During your third month you learn to draw the powers you need
                    to create your magic into your body. At the end of it, you
                    must make a difficulty 30 <t>Health</t> check. On success,
                    you gain a skill in your first Mystery at a level of 1. On
                    failure, you must begin again. At least three months must
                    pass before your next attempt.
                </para>
                <para>
                    When retrying a part of the training, you gain a +3 bonus
                    to your check for each time you have successfully completed
                    that part of it, and +1 for each time you have failed it.
                    If you succeed in the <t>Intelligence</t> stage, but fail
                    at the <t>Will</t> stage, then next time you try the
                    <t>Intelligence</t> difficulty is only 27, and the <t>Will</t>
                    is only 29.

                    Though most wizards keep to using the basic powers of
                    the Mysteries, a few strive to gain a deeper knowledge
                    of magic, by learning <e>Runes</e>. A rune is a
                    simple invocation which is associated with a Mystery,
                    and which provides a simple magical effect. Simple does
                    not mean weak however, and some rune are capable
                    of destroying a town or slaying someone with a word.

                <para>
                    Each rune must be learnt separately, and is treated
                    as a <e>technique</e>, in that they have a prerequisite
                    of a skill level and other rune. However, they
                    cannot be purchased with experience, but must
                    be learnt through meditation and self-sacrifice.

                        Learning <e>runes</e> takes at least a week, and requires
                        an <t>Intelligence</t> check of 5 * level of the <e>rune</e>.
                        Each point you roll over the target difficulty gains you one
                        point towards learning the <e>rune</e>. When you have gained

                        Most runes can be invoked in a single round, and

                <e>Earth</e> gives power over the ground and rocks, over
                animals and plants, over life and death. It is the most
                common of the Mysteries, for it is the most useful in
                day to day life. With it, wizards are able to improve
                harvests and cure diseases.

                        lasts a week, so must be cast once a week over the entire 
                        growing season. The base difficulty is 10. Multiple
                        castings do not stack, instead only the most powerful
                        effect applies. The base effect covers an area of ground
                        1m x 1m, so a small plot of plants, or a single tree.

                        a radius of 2m, would be a soft light out to 4m and
                        a soft glow out to 6m.

                    such as mud, rock, water or air. Knowledge of any of the
                    Mysteries allows you to summon an elemental of that form
                    as long as their is sufficient material around. You cannot
                    summon an elemental of water in the middle of the desert
                    where there is no water, and you cannot summon an elemental
                    of fire without a fire being already present.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The ritual of summoning an elemental spirit takes an hour
                    to perform, and normally requires a blood sacrifice - often
                    an animal, but humans allow especially powerful elementals
                    to be summoned. The spirit will remain until the next
                    sunrise or sunset. In the far north, where the days or
                    nights are long, elementals may remain bound for months at
                    a time.

                <para>
                    The base difficulty of the ritual is 10, though what this
                    binds is a mindless automation that can only carry out simple
                    instructions.

                <para>
                    A base elemental is size 3, with all other attributes at one.
                    Size or physical attributes can be raised by 1 point for each

                        The strength of the elemental can be greatly increased by
                        making a sacrifice a part of the ritual. Most commonly,
                        an animal will be used, but human sacrifice is far more
                        desirable if you are willing to ignore the moral issues.

                        The Will of the elemental is linked directly to its power.
                        A standard elemental has a Will of 1. Sacrificing an
                        animal of at least size 1 will add one to the elemental's
                        Will. An animal of at least Size 4 will give a +2 bonus.
                        A human sacrifice will give a +3 bonus.

                    It is possible to use your magic to raise the bodies of the

                    <e>Spirit</e> magic. The basics are the same for both, and
                    each raises corporeal undead known as druagr, though there
                    are subtle differences depending on which Mystery is used.

                different aspects of the world, enabling you to twist
                reality to your will. Sometimes however, reality will twist
                back, warping your mind in ways that make you not quite
                human. Though this warping is seen as a bad thing, it can
                lead to a greater understanding of the magic you are

                The basic powers of each Mystery are the safest, which is

                cantrips. Those who strive for greater understanding though
                must ultimately pay the price of magic.
