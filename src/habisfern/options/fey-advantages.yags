        <cost points="-1"/>

            <para>
                You have an air about you that people and animals can sense,
                making them uneasy in your presence. The reaction of others
                is always shifted down a level because of this, due to either
                distrust or fear. This feeling is a subtle one, and is not
                immediately obvious, but a few minutes in your presence is
                enough to make it clear.

    <advantage name="Curse of iron" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-1"/>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You feel uncomfortable around iron, and do not like its
                touch. If iron should touch your skin, it will cause pain
                and burn you, though not enough to cause serious damage.
                If you wear iron armour, or are bound by iron chains, then
                you gain a level of exhaustion every hour. This will never
                kill you though, and once you are unconscious you will
                gain no further exhaustion.

    <advantage name="Eyes of the cat" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-1"/>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The nature of your blood is visible in your eyes, for they
                are of unnatural colour and shape. They may be bright yellow,
                red or green, and the pupils are slitted like those of a cat.
                Anyone who sees your eyes will immediately realise that you
                are not normal and you will suffer one level of negative
                reaction against you, or more if they have reason to dislike
                you because of it.
