                it. A fear check is needed when the creature is first
                seen, against the level of the Horror ability. Failure
                results in the victim being struck by unnatural fear.
                See the section on Undead for details on Horror checks.

            <para>
                A blessed creature has been touched by the supernatural,
                and draws strength from some other realm. As such, it is
                able to heal damage dealt to it very quickly, making it
                almost immune to damage from normal sources. A blessed
                creature is either blessed by the light, or blessed by
                darkness. Both types of blessings behave the same, but
                creatures of the light are affected by weapons of
                darkness and vice versa.
            </para>

            <para>
                A blessed creature, on receiving either wounds or stuns,
                will immediately heal one level of both. This occurs
                after effects of the wound are accounted for. So a single
                blow which fatally wounds a creature could still kill
                it. If the creature survives however, it would then
                become critically wounded (regardless of how wound levels
                beyond fatal the creature was taken).
            </para>

            <para>
                At the end of the round, and each round thereafter, the
                creature will heal one wound and stun level, until it
                is fully healed.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some weapons may be blessed (either by light or darkness),
                and damage caused by these cannot be healed with this
                advantage. A light blessed creature cannot heal wounds
                from a darkness weapon, and vice versa.
