                An <e>Animal</e> is not capable of sapient thought in the

                instead to represent animal cunning. They may have a high
                intelligence, but aren't capable of abstract thought.

                Animals with an intelligence of 3+ may be capable of using

                tend to have an intelligence of 1, predators about 2.
